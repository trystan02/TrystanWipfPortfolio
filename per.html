    <p>To be well means to me to be in a healthy enough state that one can do most if not all the things they love without endangering, or over stressing their body and mind. Wellness and health often go hand in hand and a ‘well’ is often a healthy life. To be physically healthy can require many things; these could include a good diet and proper exercise intake. First a good diet often includes most if not all of the major food groups daily, now this doesn't mean you must eat only vegetables, nuts, and water. A healthy diet can allow for the consumption of more unhealthy foods like a bag of candy, a slice of cake, or a can of pop as long as they are not over consumed. Next proper  exercise doesn't mean you have to go to the gym every day and spend a large amount of time exercising, instead it simply means that at least once a week you do something actually physical to get your body moving and your heart pumping this can be as simple as going for a weekly run, following a workout routine, or even doing jumping jacks for a few minutes. To be physically healthy doesn't require much effort and a want to better yourself. Next, being mentally healthy could also include a fair amount of things such as talking with friends, going out in the sun, being with loved ones, or pursuing enjoyable hobbies.  First, being with friends can help you mental well being in important ways. Humans by nature are a social species and require communication and friendship for their mental health. Simply enough spending around probably half an hour a week with a friend can boost your mental health significantly. To continue loving ones such as family members or pets could have a similar if not better effect on your mental health as the human brain is built around familial structure and spending half an hour with family members once a week or even once a day could also heavily benefit your mental health. Next is spending time outside in the sun, the sun has also been proven to positively impact your mental health and lack of it has been shown to cause depression. The sun also gives your body vitamin d which is essential for our body to function properly. I would recommend at least 5 to 10 minutes a day just being out in the sun and on days where it is too cold or the sun is not out i would suggest having a lamp on close by as that can help give the positive mental health effects to a lesser degree. Finly is taking the time to pursue a positive hobby. This hobby could be anything from a sport, some field of science or math, art, singing or dancing, gaming, and hundreds more. A hobby is often a way for your brain to cool down and do something you enjoy, for example if you pursue your hobby at least once a week it can help cool your brain down from the stress of the previous week. Now it is important to note that it is a healthy hobby. This means a hobby that doesn't seriously damage your body, things like drug use or drinking alcohol would be negative hobbies as they can seriously damage your body and endanger your life and the lives around you. Another important thing is to ensure your hobby doesnt become a requirement, if your hobby becomes your job that can be great and you get to do what you love for a living but on the flip side it can make a hobby sour to you as instead of a activity you find pleasure in during your free time it becomes a job and you have to do it almost daily. This can ruin the hobby and get to the point where your hobby is now negatively affecting your mental health. With all this to be well is a challenge but if you try and want to be well it can be as easy as 3.14159.

Personal wellness is an important thing to me but often gets sidelined for other more urgent matters. More recently though wellness has been sidelined less and less as i begin to think about it more and more. One of the more important things but things I often overlook is physical health and how important that is to the function of your body. I spend most of my time in a chair typing away at a keyboard as such I'm not a very active person. So when it came time to create goals related to health I created mine about physical health. I said that I wanted to drink more water and spend more time outside. Another important aspect of wellness to me is social wellness. Once again as I spent most of my time typing away on a keyboard I don't often hang out with friends and as a more quiet person unless they wish or are forced to talk with me I often don't communicate with other people. So once again when it came time to set wellness goals I focused on social wellness and now try to hang out with friends at least once a month. As I have gotten older I have learned more about how wellness works. A while ago when I thought of wellness I thought about being active and that was about it, but now that I have learned more I know that wellness is much more complex than running around. I now know that there are many factors to being well. These can be physical like getting proper nutrition, drinking enough water, and exercise, but they can also be social like hanging out with friends or family, talking to others regularly. They can also be financial like having a good budget or investing, they can also be emotional like recognizing your emotions or finding healthy ways to release your emotions, finally there is spirituality with being happy with your beliefs and practicing things that make you spiritually happy. One concern is my physical health as I often neglect it by eating candy or not eating at all. But as I said earlier, I plan to fix that as I plan to drink more water by doing things such as adding flavor when I just can't stand the taste or checking in on myself regularly and thinking about the amount of water I have already drank that day. Another goal I have set to fix my physical wellness is spending more time outside  which is something I am succeeding in. I often walk home after work whether it's sunny or rainy. During this time I enjoy the outdoors and listen to my music.
These are the important things that I think about when it comes to wellness and hope to improve myself day by day.
