            <h1>My interests and skills</h1>
            <p>
              I have many interests and skills, most involving science or craftsmanship. Some of my interests include programming in many fields such as game development, web development, software development and more general functional development all of which I am to a low to intermediate degree of skill at. Some of my other interests include electronic circuitry, leading me to learn about logical development to help abstract ciretry and how to actually build circuits with many of the courts I build being computational. Unfortunately I am still at a more beginner level but hope to improve at this in the future. Some more interests are 3d parts modeling which go hand in hand with my interest in engineering. I enjoy devising and planning small tools or devices that I often attempt to develop and print on my 3d printer but at the moment I am not very skilled at this. Another hobby or interest I have is woodworking. I enjoy building things and creating with wood is something I find enjoyable with me creating things such as tables,planters, and ornamental objects. Unfortunately I am still quite new to woodworking and have yet to develop much skill in the field. One final interest of mine is a more general crafting that can be sewn out of fabric or can be made of string and cardboard but I enjoy crafting things out of recourse like fabric, string, cardboard, and other household materials.

            <h1>My favorite medias</h1>
            <p>
                I enjoy a multitude of entertaining media in my free time. Some things I enjoy are TV shows such as cartoons like the cartoon network Adventure time. Another thing I enjoy is occasionally reading, with most things I have read being school novel studies or books that revolve around my interests but one book series that I would say is my favorite is Deltora quest. Now one more thing to know about the media I watch is that I am a child of YouTube as it was created only a few years after I was born. I would say that a childhood favorite and still a personal favorite YouTube Channel would be a Channel called game theory from which i learned many things about science and psychology.

            <h1>Person goals and dreams</h1>
            <p>
 I hold many goals for what I want to do with my life and hope someday to achieve all of them or at least the ones I deem most important. Some of these include becoming skilled at circuitry and engineering to the point where I can make simple machines such as a RV car. Another is to produce and release a full video game to the internet that I have created myself. One final hope is to someday build my house on a plot of land out in the countryside where I would have the freedom to do almost anything I want.

            <h1>Career goals and dreams</h1>
            <p>
                Some of my goals and dreams for the future are to be able to achieve a high salary position so I will be able to support myself with the rising prices across the world and rampant inflation. One other goal/ dream is to be self employed and run my own business probably in relation to computer science. One file dream is if not self employed is to work to create video games to share with the world and connect people.

            <h1>Vacations I've been on</h1>
            <p>
                           I have been lucky enough to go on a multitude of vacations as there are many i will talk specifically of one in which i leave the country. First is the many times during the summer that I have traveled with my grandparents to Kalispell,Montana,USA in which we would stay there during the weekend. I remember a few of these trips and that they were extremely fun and a great opportunity to spend time with my grandparents. Next is the 2 times my parents have taken me to mexico. I was lucky enough in 2019 to get to go on a trip to Mexico in which we stayed at a resort. I remember spending time in the pool and looking at the scenery and local wildlife of that foreign land. i was once again lucky enough to go to mexico a second time in 2023 this time going to Mazatlan in which we got to experience a more accurate mexican lifestyle now it was not completely like how most mexicans actually live but we were more in the city and explored how they often lived. We saw how people in Mexico live over the 2 weeks there and even got to know many of the workers at a local restaurant called chili peppers. To conclude I have been lucky enough to be on a fair amount of vacations and have had many great experiences.
