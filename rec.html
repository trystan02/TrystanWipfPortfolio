        <p>In the resource choices we learned
            about money and how to manage it. 
            We completed the full course of 
            Enriched academy and finished a 
            cost of living project in which we
            learned about the monthly costs of 
            living in canada. One part of this
            module that I found really
            important was investing and I was
            excited to learn about stocks and 
            bonds and all of that as it was 
            something that I found interesting
            but just never found a good
            resource to learn from. Another
            thing that surprised me was just
            how much food costs and how much
            more the maintenance costs of the
            car are than the actual cost of the
            car. But the assignment in the end
            made me feel better about the
            future as I now have a general idea
            of how much it will cost to live a
            decent life. Another interesting 
            thing that i had heard about before
            but didn't really know much about
            was real estate investing which was
            something i thought would be a
            waste of time but because of the
            enriched academy module on it
            purchasing a rental property is now
            one of my goals in life as it is a
            decently stable source of income
            that takes very little effort.
            Another byproduct of this module is
            that it has gotten me to actually
            start thinking about my future which was something I usually avoided out of fear. Now after thinking about my future I feel less scared and more confident and it has also revealed some of the things I value more than others like valuing connection to the internet based on my interests rather than buying fancy name brand things like food. In the end this module has really increased my money sense and I am now more confident in myself and my future.
