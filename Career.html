	    <p>The career uint of calm was a usefull one to me as it helped me shape the path that i will need to take in the future. In this unit i was able to narrow my possible careers down and was able to find a few interesting ones. This unit also helped me find good programs and has given me a basic understanding of the requirements to take a program like this. This unit then made me start thinking about the qualifications that are required to be a computer programmer. This unit also introduced me to some of the tasks that i would perform as a programmer from reading job descriptions. In total this unit has helped me shape my career path and build a plan. Before this unit i was extremely scard to think about the future but after calm class as a whole i feel much more prepared.</p>
